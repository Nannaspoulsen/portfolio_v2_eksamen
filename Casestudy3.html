            HÖJSKOLENDK is a Danish folk high school offering travel-based learning programs. This project took place before I
            started studying Multimedia Design. I joined as a helper on the website design and it was my first hands-on experience
            with digital design.
            At the time, I had no formal design training, but I was deeply curious about how visuals and words could shape emotion
            and clarity.

                        My role began with helping to organize the website content and visual direction. I worked closely with the team behind
                        HÖJSKOLENDK to figure out how to communicate their main ideas: community, travel and curiosity about the world. Most of
                        my decisions were based on intuition: what felt clear, warm, and human.

                    The site needed to balance practical information (trips, prices, travel details) with emotional storytelling. I created
                    simple drafts for the navigation, mainly by observing what users asked about most often. This became my first
                    understanding of what I now know as information architecture.

                        I helped choose photos, colors, and typography that reflected openness and authenticity. We wanted the site to feel like
                        the beginning of a journey: full of light, connection, and adventure. Even without knowing about design principles or
                        UX, I naturally focused on harmony and atmosphere.

                        The developer on the team built the site and I contributed design suggestions, text edits, and layout
                        adjustments. Seeing my ideas turn into a functioning website sparked my interest in digital communication and eventually
                        led me to study Multimedia Design.

                    Looking back, this project marks the start of everything I do today. I didn’t yet know terms like “user experience” or
                    “visual hierarchy,” but I began to sense their importance. It taught me that design is not just about looks - it’s
                    about making people feel connected and informed. 
                    The letter below, written by the CPO and Partner at HØJSKOLENDK,
                    is a personal recommendation reflecting our work together on the project.
