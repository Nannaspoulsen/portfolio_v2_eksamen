            <p class="cs-intro">
                Culinaria is a conceptual platform connecting home cooks, amateur chefs, and professionals worldwide through recipes,
                food stories, and shared kitchen knowledge. 
                The project explores modular design systems, ORCA object modelling, user flows, and the ethical boundaries of design psychology.

                    <p>
                    We began the project by analysing three pre-defined personas: the Home Cook, the Amateur Cook, and the Professional Chef. Using the ORCA methodology, we identified and structured the platform’s main objects — Recipe, Food Story, Professional Chef. From there, we mapped their relationships through a nested object matrix, defining cardinalities.
                    This process established the foundation for a modular and scalable content structure.

                    <h3><span class="nr">2.</span> CTA Inventory and User Stories</h3>
                    <p>
                        Next, we developed a detailed CTA inventory to define possible actions for each user type. This clarified what each
                        persona could do — Pro Chefs create, Amateurs review, and Home Cooks save or like recipes. From this mapping, we wrote
                        user stories and selected one for each persona to visualise through user flows. This helped connect user goals directly
                        to UI functionality and system capabilities.

                        Each selected user story was turned into a user flow with decision points and loops to ensure realistic behaviour — for
                        example, login prompts or validation errors. We then built wireflows in Figma, showing how users move through the system
                        step by step. This process helped define the hierarchy of actions and made it clear how feedback messages (like “Recipe
                        saved”) and error states should appear.

                    <p>
                        With the structure and flows in place, we designed a consistent set of UI components in Figma to support the
                        system. Each component was built with reusability and clarity in mind. We focused on creating clean, modular elements
                        that could appear across different parts of the interface without losing consistency. This approach made the design
                        system scalable.

                <h3>Reflection and Learning</h3>
                <p>
                    Working with OOUX completely changed how I think about design. Starting from objects and their relationships made
                    everything clearer and more structured - every component had a defined purpose and connection. It’s a smart way to
                    design, because it keeps consistency across screens and reduces rework later. I also learned how easily design
                    psychology can shift from guiding to manipulating users, and how important it is to stay transparent in every
                    interaction.
