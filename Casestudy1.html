            <p class="cs-intro">
                Make Better Food was a group project focused on designing a recipe website to better support
                busy families in finding and preparing everyday meals. Our goal was to improve the overall user
                experience through content-first design and a strong information architecture. I contributed to
                research, content modelling, visual design, and frontend development.

                    <p>
                        We started with user research, including qualitative interviews and empathy maps, to
                        understand the daily challenges of families with children. A card sorting exercise helped us
                        learn how users naturally grouped recipe content. From this, we identified our primary target
                        group: families looking for quick, simple, and nutritious meal inspiration. This insight shaped
                        every design decision that followed.

                    <p>
                        Based on our research, we developed a new content model that emphasized metadata such as
                        preparation time, equipment, difficulty, and dietary needs. We structured the site using a clear
                        sitemap and content hierarchy designed to support filtering and quick access to relevant
                        recipes.
                        This created a more intuitive experience for users navigating the site.

                        Using our research findings, we created wireframes and tested early layouts against design
                        principles like visual hierarchy and proximity. We then developed a high-fidelity prototype in
                        Figma, focusing on warm and approachable visuals, and a calm, modern interface. We carefully
                        chose fonts, colors, and imagery to support a family-friendly brand identity.

                        The high-fidelity prototype was tested with three users through think-aloud sessions. We
                        observed how they used the filtering system and recipe pages. Based on their feedback, we made
                        several design changes. This iterative process strengthened the site’s usability.

                    <p>
                        As part of the project, I implemented a functional HTML/CSS/JavaScript front-end connected to
                        a headless WordPress backend. Recipes were dynamically fetched and displayed based on
                        user-selected filters. I also built an interactive recipe popup and designed a scalable system
                        for combining multiple filter categories. This deepened my understanding of both front-end
                        logic and API-based content delivery.

                <p>
                    This project showed me the value of early research and a content-first approach. It helped me
                    think structurally, prioritize user needs, and turn insights into clear, usable design. On the
                    technical side, I built the site from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, gaining confidence
                    in frontend development. Working with WordPress as a headless CMS taught me how to fetch
                    and display structured content via the REST API – and how to separate content from design
                    effectively.
